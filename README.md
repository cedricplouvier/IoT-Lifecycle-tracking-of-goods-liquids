# IoT tracking of goods in harsh liquid environments
## Functionality
This project researched and tested to optimal solution to track bottles of liquid in a warehouse for inventory management purposes.
Traditional RFID does not work well in liquid rich environments due to the frequency diffraction of the liquids.

## Result
A specific solution is found finding an improved performance in liquid rich environment while keeping the business cost optimal.
The solutions consists of using a the bottle cap (inductor) and glass (insulator) to generate the power for a RF signal (capacitive coupling).
Using this technique I was able to quadrupe the range compared to a traditional UHF RFID on a liquid container.
